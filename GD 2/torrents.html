        This page is about torrents, what are torrents, and what 
        they can do for you!</p>

        <p>Torrents, in short, are computer files that contain metadata about files 
            and folders to be distributed. Torrents, when used with a bittorrent client, 
            can download small parts of the original file that other people have downloaded. 
        These are called peers, and these peers allow for the downloading of a file in place of a 
        primary server. 
        When torrenting, the number to keep track of is the number of "seeders". Seeders are the users who have 
        already downloaded the file, and are letting other users download the file from them. The more seeders,
        the faster the file downloads.</p>

        <p>
            When downloading "illegal" content, such as movies, TV shows and video games, 
            the primary method to download these files is through torrenting. Which is why it is 
            illegal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, here is the Bittorrent client that, in my opinion, is the most transparent, and reliable for use!
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a></h3>
        <p>I would recommend qBittorrent as they are a open-source, cross-platform software that doesn't 
            come with the spy and malware that many other torrenting clients have. The interface is easy to 
            use, and there are many plugins that you can install to customize your experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Why no more recommended torrents?</h3>
        <p>
            The answer is that many torrent clients are riddled with malware and spybots that can do harm
            to your computer. I personally am a bit scared of testing software that is known to cause damage, 
            so I can only recommend one client. However, if you are still curious, feel free to look online!
            There are many resources on the web on sites such as reddit, online piracy forums, and reviews to search
            through.
