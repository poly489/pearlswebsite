            <h3>A Short History</h3>
        
           <div class="paragraph">
             <p>The first recorded instance of piracy, in the context of distributing copywritten works without permission,
                was done by a fourteen-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart after entering the Sistine Chapel, 
                he heard Gregorio Allegri’s Miserere being performed. The sheet music was only authorized to be viewed by three people: Leopold I, John V of Portugal, 
                and Giovanni Battista Martini. After hearing it, Mozart went back to his hotel and transcribed the entire piece from memory, 
                coming back to proofread the transcription as it was being performed. After he published the piece, the fame he gained 
                from this act had grown such so that Pope Clement XIV summoned him back to Rome to be granted papal knighthood.

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Starting in 1980s with the availability of the dial-up modem, this led to the creation of warez distribution groups.
                    Warez refers to pirated software (copied, not stolen from the source) that is distributed across the Internet.

                style="align-items:right;float:right;width:350px;height:280px;">
            </div>
                <p> The release of Napster in 1999 caused a rapid upsurge of online piracy of music, films and television 
                    although music was the main focus in the MP3 format. Napster was a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing application which allowed users to send 
                    files directly through each other, donating some power from your system for the file transfer to work.

                    Although Napster eventually shut down in 2001, lasting only 2 years, it was too late. Other iterations such as Kazaa and Limewire 
                    popped up and filled in the gap that Napster left. </p>  
                <p>
                    Although it was short-lived, Napster's reign allowed its users 
                    to dive into the grey area of content piracy. Following its shutdown, 
                    many other popular P2P file sharing programs arose: the creation 
                    and usage of Limewire quickly followed suit. Learning from the mistakes 
                    of Napster, Limewire decentralized their servers by implementing the
                     Gnutella network. The success of the BitTorrent communication protocol 
                     led to the rise of many other popular programs that are still widely 
                     used today including μTorrent, Transmission, Deluge, qBittorrent, 
                     and Tixati. Digital piracy as a continuing problem significantly 
                     impacts various stakeholders, including consumers, enterprises, 
                     and countries. This global problem can impact media- and content-oriented
                    industries.
