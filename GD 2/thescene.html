            The warez scene or "The Scene" refers to the underground, international, organized network of
            pirate groups specializing in obtaining and illegally distributing digital media for free.
            The Scene includes all form of digital media, including movies, TV shows, video games, software, 
            music, and pornography. The Scene is meant to be underground and hidden from view, only being shared
            to those within the community. However as the popularity of piracy grew, torrent files and other
            files became more visible to the public to download and share. The core of the Scene is coolness, 
            credibility (or cred), acquiring social capital instead of wealth. The more well-known and credible 
            you were in the Scene, the more respect and "original" you have become.

            The term "warez" and its leetspeak form W4r3z, are words to describe content that has been
            illegally copied and distributed online. Hence, wares. Warez are made open to distribution after
            it has been "cracked", meaning its copy-protection has been circumvented. Once the "cracker" cracks
            the software for it to be used, warez distribution groups distribute the software through torrent files.
        </p>
        <p>The warez scene started emerging in the 1970s, used by predecessors of software cracking 
            and reverse engineering groups. Their work was made available on privately run bulletin 
            board systems (BBSes). At the time, setting up a machine capable of distributing data was not trivial, 
            and required a certain amount of technical skill; this was usually taken on as a 
            technical challenge. The BBSes typically hosted several megabytes of material, 
            with the best boards having multiple phone lines, and up to one hundred megabytes 
            of storage space, a considerable expense at the time. Releases were mostly games and 
            later software. Later on, the scene moved to 

           <p>As software and hardware became more complex to prevent distribution, and the tools 
            to distribute became more readily available, warez groups, or "The Scene" (the term used to 
            describe the network of warez groups as a collective) had to change their strategies. Instead
            of simply distributing, there was a focus on cracking copyright restrictions and non-commercial reverse engineering.
            As more and more people joined the Scene, requirements for promotion within these groups 
            emerged, which prompted the rise of the artscene. The artscene refers to the creation of graphical art
            created through the use of characters and symbols posted on BBSes. These artworks are created using ANSI and ASCII
            to create text-based art, and many artists within this scene would design the .nfo (info) file of the crack. These 
            .nfo files would act as the press release for the group, and would act as the certificate of authenticity
            explicitly explaining what group released the software and described what modifications (or cracks) were
            applied, if any. Once a group had packaged a crack with an .nfo, it was officially owned by that 
            group and no other group could ethically rerelease that package. </p> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also within the Scene emerged another subculture known as the DemoScene. The DemoScene is completely legal,
            as this scene is a collection of artists, muscicians, and computer programmers build short but 
            increasingly complex, procedural animations called "demos" to showcase their technological mastery.
