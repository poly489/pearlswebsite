    Ah, VPNs, the amazing service that they provide. First of all, what is a VPN?
</p>
<p>
    A VPN, or virtual private network, is an online service that provides a mobile app, 
    desktop app, browser extension or other software that encrypts your internet traffic 
    to help boost your privacy online. A VPN also prevents your internet service provider 
    from tracking which websites or apps you're using and stops most of those websites and 
    apps from seeing your actual geographic location, allowing you to bypass content blocks
     in some countries to access critical news and educational information, while also 
     opening up your streaming entertainment options. The best VPN delivers a strong level 
     of privacy protection without compromising on performance. We strongly recommend using 
     a good VPN for everyday use as well as for work, particularly if your work involves
      handling sensitive information.
    </p> 
<h3 style="color:hotpink;"><a href="https://mullvad.net/en">Mullvad VPN</a></h3>
    <p>
    Mullvad is the VPN that I personally use. Mullvad is an independent and open-source VPN provider 
    that is focused on building trust through transparency and its commitment to protecting the
     privacy and security of its users. Although there are other VPNs that are considerably more 
     well-known in the industry, Mullvad's offering overall is just as polished and easy to use 
     as many of the bigger players in the market.
    </p>

<p>The company says it doesn't keep any logs of its users' activity, and is, for the most part, 
    pretty transparent about how it operates and what it does to protect user privacy. Mullvad 
    is unique in that it doesn't require any personal information at signup. While most VPN 
    providers ask users to provide an email address and enter a username, Mullvad generates 
    a random 16-digit account number to activate each new user account. You don't even need 
    to provide any payment information since Mullvad accepts cash sent via mail.</p>


    <p>Mullvad's source code being entirely open source is a testament to the company's transparency.
    Although Mullvad tells us a new security audit is forthcoming, the company's 2020 security audit 
    (conducted by German cybersecurity firm Cure53) 
    concluded at the time that the VPN "does a great job protecting the end user from common 
    PII leaks and privacy-related risks."</p>

    <p>Mullvad VPN is 5 dollars a month, with no other deals for a yearly plan. Just 5 dollars a month.</p>    
    
    <h3 style="color:hotpink;"><a href="https://protonvpn.com/">Proton VPN</a></h3>
<p>
    Proton VPN is a great and free VPN for users who want to try out a VPN. 
    This includes just three VPN server locations (Japan, Netherlands, and the US) 
    and only allows one device to be connected at a time. You do have to create an 
    account with Proton VPN to access its free tier, but you also get access to the 
    rest of the Proton product line (Drive, Calendar, Mail), including the new Proton 
    Pass password manager. Neither Mullvad VPN nor IVPN requires you to create an 
    account or give them any information, even for paid subscriptions.</p>

<p>Even though you must create an account to use it, the free version of Proton VPN is 
    uniquely valuable because it does not limit the amount of data you can use. 
    TunnelBear VPN's free offering limits you to 500MB (upgradeable to 1.5GB) of 
    secured traffic per month, for example.</p> 

<p>Proton VPN is 9.99 €/mo, or 3.99 €/mo for 24 months, or 5.99 €/mo for 12 months</p>

<h3 style="color:hotpink;"><a href="https://windscribe.com/">Windscribe VPN</a></h3>
    <p>Windscribe has fast internet speeds, comes with built-in ad block,
     split-tunneling for those who use it, and can bypass region locked content
      on streaming services like all the VPNs on this list do.</p>
    

   <p> Windscribe VPN has a monthly plan of 9.00 per month, or 5.75 a month for a yearly plan, 
    and you can also build your plan according to your usage, and there is also a free plan.</p> 


<h3 style="color:hotpink;"><a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internt Acess VPN (PIAVPN)</a></h3>
    <p>Private Internet Access is one of the oldest surviving VPN services. 
    It has an excellent interface and advanced network settings that let tinkerers tinker. 
    Recently, the company removed its limit on simultaneous connections, helping justify 
    its high monthly cost.</p>

<p>PIAVPN is 11.95/mo for a monthly plan or 1.98/mo for 3 years + 4 months, and 3.33/mo for one year</p>
